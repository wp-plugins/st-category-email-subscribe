Plugin to allow visitors to subscribe based on category of posts

== Description ==

Surprisingly there is no plugin available to allow users to subscribe for posts on a wordpress website based on category.
 A subscriber for one category might not want to receive posts of another category. This plugin will help you to do that.
 Once a subscriber is added for a particular category, he/she will receive emails as soon as a post is published in that category.


** Features **
1. Add Subscribers for their desired category
2. Use Widget or Short Code to display Subscriber Form

4. Email will be sent to all subscribers as soon as a post is published in that category

   Upload folder `st-category-email-subscribe` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add Subscribers in  St Category Email Subscribe > Subscribers (See How to use in Other Notes)
3. Place [st_category_subscribe_form] in your page/post where you want to display the subscriber form
4. You may also use the Widget : Category Email Subscribe Form to display subscriber form
